			<h2>Hi, Im John Renz Oatis</h2>
			<p>Im a 4th year student in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Section 4-1, Major in System Development, College of Engineering, Central Luzon State University.</p>
			<p>All I can say that this course is never been my first choice, but due to some circumstances I ended up choosing this one.</p>
			<p>As student I'm scared of failing this course since I got no background knowledge or any sort of understanding about the lessons. But throughout the years pass i experience hardship and also enjoyment. Yes, I never thought that I would enjoy this course as much as I hate it. I enjoy the part where I succeeded in making my programs to run properly after many failures, errors, and retries. It makes me feel I made something amazing with does little achievements.</p>
